**Explicit Key Assumptions for Flat-File Data**

The `keyed` package brings database-style primary key protections to R
data frames. Declare which columns must be unique, and `keyed` enforces
that constraint through filters, joins, and mutations. When assumptions
break, it errors immediately instead of failing silently downstream.

## Quick Start

``` r

library(keyed)

# Declare a primary key (errors if not unique)
orders <- data.frame(
  order_id = 1:4,
  item     = c("apple", "bread", "apple", "cheese"),
  qty      = c(2, 1, 5, 3)
)
orders <- key(orders, order_id)

# Key persists through dplyr
orders |> dplyr::filter(qty > 1) |> has_key()
#> [1] TRUE

# Watch for automatic drift detection
orders <- orders |> watch()
modified <- orders |> dplyr::mutate(qty = qty * 10)
check_drift(modified)
#> Drift detected
#> Modified: 4 row(s)
#>   qty: 4 change(s)
```

## Statement of Need

In databases, you declare `customer_id` as a primary key and the engine
enforces uniqueness. With CSV and Excel files, you get no such
guarantees. Duplicates slip in silently, joins produce unexpected row
counts, and data assumptions are implicit.

Existing validation packages (pointblank, validate) offer comprehensive
rule engines but require upfront schema definitions. For analysts
working interactively with flat files, this overhead is often too high.
The result: assumptions go unchecked, and errors surface far from their
source.

`keyed` addresses this gap with four lightweight mechanisms:

| Feature | What it does |
|----|----|
| **Keys** | Declare unique columns, enforced through transformations |
| **Locks** | Assert conditions (no NAs, row counts, coverage) at pipeline checkpoints |
| **UUIDs** | Track row identity through filters, joins, and reshaping |
| **Watch & Diff** | Auto-snapshot before each transformation, cell-level drift reports |

All four work directly on data frames with no external dependencies, so
you get key safety without leaving R.

## Features

### Keys

Declare which columns must be unique. Keys persist through base R and
dplyr operations, and block any transformation that would break
uniqueness.

``` r

# Single or composite keys
customers <- key(customers, customer_id)
sales     <- key(sales, region, year)

# Keys survive filtering
active <- customers[customers$status == "active", ]
has_key(active)
#> [1] TRUE

# Uniqueness-breaking operations are blocked
customers |> dplyr::mutate(customer_id = 1)
#> Error: Key is no longer unique after transformation.
#> i Use `unkey()` first if you intend to break uniqueness.
```

### Join Diagnostics

Preview join cardinality before executing:

``` r

diagnose_join(customers, orders, by = "customer_id")
#> Cardinality: one-to-many
#> customers: 1000 rows (unique)
#> orders:    5432 rows (4432 duplicates)
#> Left join will produce ~5432 rows
```

### Locks

Assert conditions at pipeline checkpoints. Locks error immediately,
never continuing silently.

``` r

customers |>
  lock_unique(customer_id) |>
  lock_no_na(email) |>
  lock_nrow(min = 100)
```

Available locks:

| Function                            | Checks                   |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `lock_unique(df, col)`              | No duplicate values      |
| `lock_no_na(df, col)`               | No missing values        |
| `lock_complete(df)`                 | No NAs in any column     |
| `lock_coverage(df, threshold, col)` | % non-NA above threshold |
| `lock_nrow(df, min, max)`           | Row count in range       |

### UUIDs

Generate stable row identifiers when your data has no natural key. UUIDs
survive all transformations and enable row-level tracking.

``` r

customers <- add_id(customers)

# Track which rows were added or removed
filtered <- customers |> dplyr::filter(name != "Bob")
compare_ids(customers, filtered)
#> Lost: 1 row (7b1e4a9c2f8d3601)
#> Kept: 2 rows
```

### Watch & Diff

[`watch()`](https://gillescolling.com/keyed/reference/watch.md) turns
drift detection from a manual ceremony into an automatic safety net.
Watched data frames auto-snapshot before each dplyr verb, so
[`check_drift()`](https://gillescolling.com/keyed/reference/check_drift.md)
always gives you a cell-level report of what the last transformation
changed.

``` r

df <- key(data.frame(id = 1:5, x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)), id) |> watch()

# Every dplyr verb auto-snapshots before executing
filtered <- df |> dplyr::filter(id <= 3)
check_drift(filtered)
#> Drift detected
#> Removed: 2 row(s)
#> Unchanged: 3 row(s)

# Each step in a chain tracks drift from the previous step
result <- filtered |> dplyr::mutate(x = x * 100)
check_drift(result)
#> Drift detected
#> Modified: 3 row(s)
#>   x: 3 change(s)
```

You can also compare any two keyed data frames directly with
[`diff()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/diff.html):

``` r

old <- key(data.frame(id = 1:3, x = c("a", "b", "c")), id)
new <- data.frame(id = 2:4, x = c("B", "c", "d"))

diff(old, new)
#> Key: id
#> Removed: 1 row(s)
#> Added: 1 row(s)
#> Modified: 1 row(s)
#>   x: 1 change(s)
#> Unchanged: 1 row(s)
```

Use [`unwatch()`](https://gillescolling.com/keyed/reference/unwatch.md)
to stop automatic stamping, or
[`clear_all_snapshots()`](https://gillescolling.com/keyed/reference/clear_all_snapshots.md)
to free memory.

## Support

> “Software is like sex: it’s better when it’s free.” — Linus Torvalds

I’m a PhD student who builds R packages in my free time because I
believe good tools should be free and open. I started these projects for
my own work and figured others might find them useful too.

If this package saved you some time, buying me a coffee is a nice way to
say thanks. It helps with my coffee addiction.
