# keyed: Explicit Key Assumptions for Flat-File Data

Helps make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching keys to
flat-file data that error when those assumptions are violated. Designed
for CSV-first workflows without database infrastructure or version
control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, join diagnostics,
and automatic drift detection via watched data frames that snapshot
before each transformation and report cell-level changes.
