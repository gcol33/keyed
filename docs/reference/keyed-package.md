# keyed: Explicit Key Assumptions for Flat-File Data

Helps R users make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching keys
to flat-file data and warning when those assumptions are violated.
Designed for CSV-first workflows without databases, schemas, or version
control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, join diagnostics,
and optional drift detection against reference snapshots.
