\title{Check for potential join explosion before executing}
\usage{
diagnose_join(x, y, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Left data frame.}

\item{y}{Right data frame.}

\item{by}{Join specification.}
}
\value{
A list with cardinality information.
}
\description{
Analyzes join cardinality without performing the full join.
Useful for detecting many-to-many joins that would explode row count.
}
\examples{
x <- data.frame(id = c(1, 1, 2), a = 1:3)
y <- data.frame(id = c(1, 1, 2), b = 4:6)
diagnose_join(x, y, by = "id")
