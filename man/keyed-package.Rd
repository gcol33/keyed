\title{keyed: Explicit Key Assumptions for Flat-File Data}
\description{
Helps make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching keys to flat-file data and erroring when those assumptions are violated. Designed for CSV-first workflows without databases, schemas, or version control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, join diagnostics, and optional drift detection against reference snapshots.
