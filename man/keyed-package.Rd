\title{keyed: Explicit Key Assumptions for Flat-File Data}
\description{
Helps R users make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching keys to flat-file data and warning when those assumptions are violated. Designed for CSV-first workflows without databases, schemas, or version control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, validated joins, and optional drift detection against reference snapshots.
