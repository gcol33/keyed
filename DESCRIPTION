Description: Helps make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching
    keys to flat-file data and erroring when those assumptions are violated.
    Designed for CSV-first workflows without databases, schemas, or version
    control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, join diagnostics, and
    optional drift detection against reference snapshots.
