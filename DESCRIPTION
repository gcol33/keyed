Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R:
    person("Gilles", "Colling", , email = "gilles@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Helps R users make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching
    keys to flat-file data and warning when those assumptions are violated.
    Designed for CSV-first workflows without databases, schemas, or version
    control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, validated joins, and
    optional drift detection against reference snapshots.
