Description: Helps make implicit data assumptions explicit by attaching
    keys to flat-file data that error when those assumptions are violated.
    Designed for CSV-first workflows without database infrastructure or version
    control. Provides key definition, assumption checks, join diagnostics,
    and automatic drift detection via watched data frames that snapshot before
    each transformation and report cell-level changes.
